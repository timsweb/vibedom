# Vibedom - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview

**Vibedom** is a hardware-isolated sandbox environment for running AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) safely on Apple Silicon Macs.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 complete. Phase 2 DLP complete (real-time scrubbing, audit logging). Persistent container workflow complete (iterative development with bidirectional sync).

**Primary Goal**: Enable safe AI agent usage in enterprise environments with compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **VM Isolation** (`lib/vibedom/vm.py`)
    - Supports both apple/container (preferred) and Docker (fallback)
    - Read-only workspace mount at `/mnt/workspace`
    - Agent workspace at `/work/repo` (bind-mounted from host — persists for persistent containers)
    - Claude Code CLI pre-installed with persistent config volume
    - Health check polling for VM readiness
    - `exists()` / `is_running()` / `pause()` / `restart()` for persistent container lifecycle

2. **Container State** (`lib/vibedom/container_state.py`)
   - `ContainerState` dataclass persisted as `~/.vibedom/containers/{name}/container.json`
   - Tracks workspace, runtime, proxy PID/port, status (running/stopped)
   - `ContainerRegistry` for discovering/looking up containers by workspace name or path

3. **Network Control** (`lib/vibedom/proxy.py`, `lib/vibedom/container/mitmproxy_addon.py`)
   - ProxyManager starts mitmproxy as a **host process** (not inside the container)
   - One process per container/session on an OS-assigned port (no hardcoded ports)
   - Port and PID stored in `container.json` or `state.json` for whitelist reload
   - Proxy auto-restarts on `vibedom up`/`vibedom shell` if PID is dead
   - Container receives `HTTP_PROXY=http://host.docker.internal:<port>` and CA cert via `/mnt/config/mitmproxy/`
   - Domain whitelist enforcement with subdomain support
   - DLP scrubber for secret and PII detection in outbound HTTP traffic
   - Logs all requests to `network.jsonl`

4. **Secret Detection** (`lib/vibedom/gitleaks.py`)
   - Pre-flight Gitleaks scan before VM starts
   - Risk categorization (critical vs warnings)
   - Interactive review UI for findings

5. **Session Management** (`lib/vibedom/session.py`)
   - Structured logging (JSONL for network, text for events)
   - Session directories: `~/.vibedom/logs/session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-microseconds/`
   - Retained for ephemeral session workflow

6. **CLI** (`lib/vibedom/cli.py`)
   - **Persistent containers**: `up`, `down`, `destroy`, `status`, `shell`, `pull`, `push`
   - **Ephemeral sessions**: `run`, `stop`, `attach`, `review`, `merge`
   - **Shared**: `init`, `reload-whitelist`, `list`, `rm`, `prune`, `housekeeping`, `proxy-restart`

### Key Design Decisions

**Two container models**: Persistent (recommended) and ephemeral (retained for compatibility)
- Persistent: `vibedom up/down` — container survives across tasks, repo bind-mounted from `~/.vibedom/containers/{name}/repo/`, sync via rsync
- Ephemeral: `vibedom run/stop` — fresh container per task, repo cloned on start, changes extracted as git bundle on stop

**Idempotent startup**: `startup.sh` skips git clone if `/work/repo/.git` exists
- Enables container restart without re-cloning
- SSH agent socket check prevents duplicate agents on restart

**Host-side rsync for sync**: `pull`/`push` rsync directly between host paths
- Container repo is a bind mount, so no `docker exec` needed
- `.gitignore` rules applied via `--filter=':- .gitignore'`
- `sync_exclude:` in `vibedom.yml` for project-specific additional excludes
- Additive by default (no `--delete`); destructive mode opt-in

**Git Bundle Workflow** (ephemeral sessions): Git-native approach for agent changes
- Rationale: Cleaner code review, better GitLab integration, preserves commit history
- Implementation: Container clones workspace, creates git bundle at session end

**Explicit Proxy**: HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables
- Rationale: Works with both HTTP and HTTPS
- Implementation: Environment variables set at container level, mitmproxy in regular mode
- Proxy port is baked into the container env at creation — restart must use same port
- Proxy auto-restart on `vibedom up` / `vibedom shell` if PID is dead

**Deploy Keys**: Unique SSH key per machine
- Rationale: Avoid exposing personal credentials to VM
- Setup: `vibedom init` generates key, user adds to GitLab/GitHub

## Development Workflow

### Persistent Container Workflow (Primary)

**Setup (once per project):**
- Add `vibedom.yml` with `base_image`, `network`, `setup` commands, `sync_exclude`
- `vibedom up ~/projects/myapp` — creates container, runs setup commands

**Iterative development:**
```
vibedom shell myapp          # open shell, run agent inside
vibedom pull myapp src/      # pull agent's changes to host
# review, test, amend locally
vibedom push myapp src/      # push amendments back to container
# repeat
```

**Between tasks:**
- `vibedom down myapp` — stops container, environment preserved
- `vibedom up myapp` — restarts, no re-clone, proxy auto-restarts

### Ephemeral Session Workflow (Legacy / Isolated Tasks)

**Container Initialization:**
- Git workspaces: Cloned from host, checkout current branch
- Non-git workspaces: Fresh git init with snapshot commit
- Agent works in `/work/repo` (mounted to `~/.vibedom/logs/session-xyz/repo`)

**During Session:**
- Agent commits normally to isolated repo

**After Session:**
- Git bundle created at `~/.vibedom/logs/session-xyz/repo.bundle`
- User adds bundle as remote, reviews commits
- User merges into feature branch (with or without squash)
- User pushes feature branch for GitLab MR

### Git Worktrees

**Preferred location**: `.worktrees/` (hidden, project-local)

New features should be developed in isolated worktrees:
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-name -b feature-name
cd .worktrees/feature-name
```

### Test-Driven Development

All features follow TDD:
1. Write failing test
2. Run test to verify it fails
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Run test to verify it passes
5. Commit

**Test organization**:
- `tests/test_*.py` - Unit tests (no Docker required)
- Core logic: 100% passing
- Docker-dependent tests: May fail in sandboxed environments

### Code Quality Standards

- **DRY**: Extract constants, avoid magic numbers
- **YAGNI**: No speculative features
- **Error handling**: Contextual messages, proper exception chaining
- **Type hints**: Use throughout (except CLI functions use Click decorators)
- **Docstrings**: Include usage examples for public APIs

### Technical Debt Tracking

**Document deferred improvements in**: `docs/technical-debt.md`

**Current high-priority items**:
- File I/O error handling in network logging
- Input validation for log methods

## Known Limitations

### Persistent Container Sync

**Current Implementation:**
- Sync is manual — user runs `vibedom pull`/`vibedom push` explicitly
- No automatic file watching or live sync
- Full-tree sync requires confirmation (path-specific sync does not)

### Git Bundle Workflow (Ephemeral Sessions)

**Current Implementation:**
- Agent works on same branch as user's current branch
- Bundle contains all refs from session
- User decides to keep commits or squash during merge

### Proxy Mode

**Current Implementation**:
- Explicit proxy mode with HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables
- Works for 95%+ of modern tools (curl, pip, npm, git)
- Tools that don't respect HTTP_PROXY may not be proxied

**Known edge cases**:
- Some legacy applications may ignore proxy environment variables
- Certificate-pinning applications (banking apps) will reject mitmproxy's CA
- Docker-in-Docker requires additional proxy configuration

**Mitigation**:
- Document tool-specific proxy configuration
- Create wrapper scripts for problematic tools if discovered
- Most AI agent workflows use standard tools that respect HTTP_PROXY

### Container Runtime

**Current**: Supports both apple/container (preferred) and Docker (fallback). Runtime is auto-detected at startup.

**Claude Code Persistence**: Uses a shared Docker volume (`vibedom-claude-config`) to persist authentication and settings across all workspaces.

**Future**: Enhancements to apple/container integration as the platform matures.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_gitleaks.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=lib/vibedom --cov-report=html
```

### Test Results (Phase 1)

- **Core logic**: 18/18 passing (100%)

```

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2: DLP and Monitoring ✅ (Complete)

- ✅ **DLP scrubbing**: Real-time secret and PII scrubbing in HTTP traffic
- ✅ **Shared patterns**: gitleaks.toml serves pre-flight scan + runtime DLP
- ✅ **Audit logging**: Scrubbed findings logged to network.jsonl

### Phase 2b: Persistent Containers ✅ (Complete)

- ✅ **Persistent containers**: `vibedom up/down/destroy` — container survives across tasks
- ✅ **Bidirectional sync**: `vibedom push/pull` with `.gitignore`-aware rsync
- ✅ **Setup scripts**: `setup:` in `vibedom.yml` for one-time environment setup
- ✅ **Proxy auto-restart**: proxy health checked and restarted on `up`/`shell`

### Phase 3: Production Hardening

- **High-severity alerting**: Real-time notifications for critical DLP findings
- **Log rotation**: Implement size limits and rotation policies
- **Session/container cleanup**: Automatic cleanup with retention policies
- **Multi-tenant support**: Workspace isolation for multiple users

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Model

- **VM isolation**: Agent cannot escape to host via kernel exploits
- **Read-only workspace**: Original files protected from malicious writes
- **Forced proxy**: All traffic routed through mitmproxy (no bypass)
- **Deploy keys**: Unique SSH key per machine (not personal credentials)
- **DLP scrubbing**: Real-time secret/PII detection and scrubbing in HTTP traffic
- **Pre-flight scanning**: Gitleaks scan before VM starts
- **Sync path validation**: `pull`/`push` reject absolute paths and `../` traversal

### Known Security Limitations

- **Proxy bypass**: Tools that don't respect HTTP_PROXY can bypass whitelist (~5%)
- **HTTPS response scrubbing**: Currently only scrubs requests, not responses (by design - not a threat vector for prompt injection)

### Future Security Enhancements

- Kernel-level network filtering as fallback for non-proxy-aware tools
- High-severity alerting for critical DLP findings
